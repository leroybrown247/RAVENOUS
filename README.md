# Ravenous Part 1:

### Creating Project & Components

Welcome to the Ravenous project, where you’ll be building a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, you’ll be creating an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.

In this first part of a four-part project, you will lay the foundations of Ravenous by building the website’s homepage. By the end, you will have created a static interface for Ravenous, which features a header, a search bar, and a list of businesses.

Through the four parts of Ravenous, you’ll build upon this foundation, adding features such as sorting and filtering options, and dynamic search results. By the end of the project, you’ll have developed a fully functional restaurant recommendation website that will help users find their next favorite eatery.

## Project Requirements

- Build the restaurant recommendation application using React

- Utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the tech stack

- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub

## Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:

- The purpose of your project
- Technologies used
- Features
- Future work
- Features

The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar
A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.

## Prerequisites

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Git and GitHub
- HTTP Requests and Responses
- Authentication

# Ravenous Part 2: Passing Information

Welcome back to Ravenous! In Part 2 of the project, you will continue building upon the knowledge you gained in Part 1. This phase will focus on transferring information between components more efficiently while reducing hardcoding.

Your objective will be to refactor the existing components using the standard unidirectional information flow pattern of a React application. This will establish a foundation for integrating with the Yelp API in the future and make data management easier.

Completing Ravenous Part 2 will give you a better understanding of React components and how they can collaborate to create a dynamic and adaptable web application.

## Project Requirements

- Build the restaurant recommendation application using React

- Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the tech stack

- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub

- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:

- The purpose of your project

- Technologies used

- Features

- Future work

- Deploy your application and make it and accessible by users.

## Features

The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.

Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar
A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.

Information is transferred efficiently between components using a unidirectional data flow pattern commonly used in React applications.

# Ravenous Part 4: Interacting with the Yelp API

Welcome to the exciting final installment of the Ravenous project! As you approach the finish line, you’ll be putting the finishing touches on your creation.

In Ravenous Part 3, you incorporated state into your React components. Now, in Part 4, you’ll connect your application to the Yelp API and enable users to interact with the web app to see live data that corresponds to their inputs.

You’ll be using your existing knowledge of React events and event handlers to create a responsive and interactive user interface. You’ll need to capture user input using event listeners, update component state based on user actions, and create dynamic user interfaces that respond with real data.

By the end of Ravenous Part 4, you’ll have achieved your goal of creating a fully functional clone of Yelp, complete with the ability to retrieve data from the Yelp API and present it through the polished interface you’ve developed.
